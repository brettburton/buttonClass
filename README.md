buttonClass
===========

a simple button class written for Processing

I created this for a Processing class I was teaching.  I wanted something to let us create lots of buttons quickly.

KNOWN ISSUES
Buttons turbo fire, need to make them single fire with reset on mouse release.

The Displayed text or shape do not necessarily overlap with the actual clickable area.
Should add rectangle shape as a true/false bool for the text style button.
